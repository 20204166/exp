"""Deterministic scheduling fakes shared by coordinator, timer and concurrency tests.

The deferred runner models the exact worker queue ``AppCoordinator`` consumes
without real threads; the timer master models the Tk ``after`` protocol
``AppWindow`` depends on. Both are deliberately minimal: they record the
scheduling contract and let tests step time explicitly.
